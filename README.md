# Kilian

Kilian is a Discord bot that manages channels and roles. 
He was forged to meet the requirements for our **BigBrains** Server, but he likes to join and manage other servers as well.
His main purpose is to manage invisible roles on Discord.

Why invisible roles, you ask? - Great question.

On our server we have a lot of roles to manage which user should see which channel. 
Now if a user is visiting 12 courses they have these 12 roles and some vanity roles.
But no one wants to see this wall of roles when clicking on a user, so we decided to hide them.
Another advantage of letting Kilian hide the roles is that he automatically manages the roles of all users which want to see the uni-channels and we do not have to move a finger anymore. 

## Usage
### Start

Use `python kilian.py` to start the bot. 
At every startup, Kilian will pull all courses for the current semester from KUSSS. This can take a few moments.
When everything is done, Kilian will greet you properly on the commandline.

### /kusss

The command `/kusss <link> [student-id]` subscribes to the Kilian™ services.
Parameter `link` is the link for the calendar file in [KUSSS](https://www.kusss.jku.at/kusss).
The proper link can be obtained from [here](https://www.kusss.jku.at/kusss/ical-multi-form-sz.action) by clicking Create and copying the link.
Optional parameter `student-id` is the users student id and may be provided so others can check it if they need it for a group project, for example.

### /unkusss

`/unkusss` unsubscribes you from all Kilian™ services and removes all related collected data.

### /ping | @ManagedRole

`/ping <@ManagedRole> [Content]` lets you ping all users which attend the course, just like @ManagedRole does.
The advantage of pinging such a managed role is, that these Managed roles are not visible in Discord at all.
Further information on that can be found in the Implementation Details.

### /studid

The `studid <@User>`-Command returns the student id of the user if they provided it with their link.

### /sleep

`/sleep` shuts Kilian down properly. 
This command can only be run by Kilians dads, so make sure to be one of them!


## Implementation Details

## Requirements

Requirements are listed and can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Get a working discord bot: 
  * Follow [this guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) to get your bot 
  * Set all "Priviledged Gateway Intents" to true
  * Important note: Select `bot` and `applications.commands` as scope
  * Add the bot to your server with "Administrator" permissions
  * Reset and copy your bot token!

Fill out `config.json`
  * Paste your bot-token into the corresponding field
  * Paste your discord-id as a string into the "dads" list (to turn Kilian off properly)
  
## Known issues and errors

### AuditLog error messages in the command line

Don't worry about those error messages, they are from the [`interactions.py`](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py) package and to us these are completely normal.

### Scalability issues
  * If two or more persons use Kilians `/kusss`-Command at the same time, courses are generated multiple times.
  * If 250 roles are generated in less than 48 hours, discord will block your bot for 24 hours. ([source](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360050533812-Extreme-rate-limits-on-the-role-create-endpoint))

## Future ideas
  * Use more bots at the same time as "creating-slaves" to get rid of discord blocking the bot.
  * Deleting unused roles and channels on `/unkusss`
  * Add an "Archivesniffer"-Role to give people permissions to view older channels
  * Add a "Veteran"-Role to give people permissions to get into channels and help others
  * `/studygroup`: Create a private voicechannel for - hmm.. well - studygroups
  * `/hiderole <@Role>`: Hide a already existent role and provide Kilians standard features for it
  * `/showrole <@Role>`: Reverse `/hiderole`
